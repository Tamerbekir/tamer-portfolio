# User Story

AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>

# Description
This is a portfolio that includes the works/projects of Tamer Bekir. This site includes the current, as well as future links to upcoming projects. So far, there is only an active image that directs the user to the first project. It also holds navigational links that will take you directly to said links- these links will then take you to the correct sites. This page includes Tamer's contact information, such as email, social media account(s), GitHub, and a downloadable resume that can be saved directly to a machine. All images have been credited below.
